A work-in-progress tool to edit NieR;Automata save games.

Currently allows you to edit the following:
- Your username
- The amount of money you have
- The amount of experience you have (the game doesn't store your level, you just have to edit this)
- Plug-in Chips

Furthermore it can automatically patch the header of a save game you copied over from someone else.

To run it:

Either run N\_A\_editor.py directly using Python 3.

Or run the executables found [here](https://github.com/CensoredUsername/NieR-Automata-editor/releases)
